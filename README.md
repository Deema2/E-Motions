The idea of this exceptinal project is to extend the effect of textual content to create new type of Art. Emotional classification has been taken as the testing for the system, but the idea could be adapted to multiple fields for visual representation based on text input.

The application is composed of two components: the AI model (which is developed using Python), and the 3D generator code (which is built using Java). The communication between the languages is through a RESTful API developed using Java to support the compatiblity of the 3D Generator code. The library used to build the backend is Spring.

To run the Java code, it is important to download all dependencies, including all .jar files.
